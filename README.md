## A description fot this project
For having an interactive console its important:
* Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
